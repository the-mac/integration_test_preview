## Main features

* Preview any device from any device
* Change the device orientation
* Dynamic system configuration (*language, dark mode, text scaling factor, ...)*
* Freeform device with adjustable resolution and safe areas
* Keep the application state
* Plugin system (*Screenshot, File explorer, ...*)
* Customizable plugins

## Quickstart

### Add dependency to your pubspec file

Since Device Preview is a simple Dart package, you have to declare it as any other dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  device_preview: <latest version>
```

### Add DevicePreview

Wrap your app's root widget in a `DevicePreview` and make sure to :

* Set your app's `useInheritedMediaQuery` to `true`.
* Set your app's `builder` to `DevicePreview.appBuilder`.
* Set your app's `locale` to `DevicePreview.locale(context)`.

> Make sure to override the previous properties as described. If not defined, `MediaQuery` won't be simulated for the selected device.

```dart
import 'package:device_preview/device_preview.dart';

void main() => runApp(
  DevicePreview(
    enabled: !kReleaseMode,
    builder: (context) => MyApp(), // Wrap your app
  ),
);

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      useInheritedMediaQuery: true,
      locale: DevicePreview.locale(context),
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder,
      theme: ThemeData.light(),
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
      home: const HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Limitations

Think of Device Preview as a first-order approximation of how your app looks and feels on a mobile device. With Device Mode you don't actually run your code on a mobile device. You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop, desktop or tablet.

> There are some aspects of mobile devices that Device Preview will never be able to simulate. When in doubt, your best bet is to actually run your app on a real device.
