# Contribute

Please read through the following guidelines that explain how to contribute to the [integration_test_preview](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/integration_test_preview) pub.dev package.

### Improve docs

As a user you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.
    Use discussions for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure you’re using the latest version of our packages
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Run `flutter build` locally to build, format, and test your changes
*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
*   Don’t include unrelated changes
*   Test before submitting code by running `flutter test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it’s your job to convince us
